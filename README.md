# Fluid Simulation

## Description
This is a **real-time 2D fluid simulation** based on the **Navier-Stokes equations**, implemented using **Python, NumPy, and Pygame**. It simulates fluid movement and allows users to interact with the simulation by adding velocity and density.

## Features
- **Realistic Fluid Behavior**: Simulates velocity, diffusion, and advection.
- **User Interaction**: Click and drag to introduce fluid and velocity.
- **Toggleable Velocity Field**: Press `V` to visualize velocity vectors.
- **Pause and Resume**: Press `SPACE` to pause or resume the simulation.
- **Clear Simulation**: Press `C` to reset the fluid state.
- **Random Forces**: Press `R` to add random forces and density.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- NumPy
- Pygame

### Install Dependencies
Run the following command to install the required libraries:

```bash
pip install numpy pygame
